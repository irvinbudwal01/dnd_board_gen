Generate a simple grid and upload icons to represent players/other entities!
Use 9/0 to change size of icons. Avoid using the tree icon or icons with a lot of detail. 
Shift click to delete icons in grid. Alt + drag to lock them into a quadrant of a gridspace. This feature becomes less effective at higher dimensions.
